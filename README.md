ous steps hence waterfall.



Waterfall Model
Agile Model
Roles:
Assigns roles to project team members, with specific duties and responsibilities defined for each team member.
Empowers team members to collaborate on different aspects of the project over time, leading to a more self-organizing team structure.
Planning;
Planning is a linear process done at the beginning of the project, with all requirements and objectives laid out in detail upfront.
Planning is a continuous process throughout the project's life cycle, with adjustments made as new information or requirements emerge.
Scope;
Discourages changes to the project's scope because the methodology requires an extensive amount of time spent in the beginning trying to get the plan right, which can make changes costlier after the project has begun.
Agile is more adaptable to changes in scope, with the development team able to adjust quickly as requirements change.
Time frames;
Designed for long-term projects with predetermined timelines.
Uses short iterations to deliver value rapidly, allowing teams to adjust plans over time and achieve shorter time frames.
Speed;
Waterfall projects tend to take longer because all requirements must be agreed upon before development can begin.
Agile projects, on the other hand, are usually delivered more rapidly than waterfall projects due to the iterative development cycles used in agile.
Delivery;
Waterfall requires the completion of all tasks before any work can be released.
Agile allows for quick delivery of projects with shorter lifecycles, as each iteration delivers a workable product.
Flexibility;
Waterfall is less flexible and resistant to change once the project's scope has been defined.
Agile encourages teams to respond quickly and adaptively to changes during the development process.
Testing;
In waterfall, testing is usually done at specific milestones, often towards the end of the project.
Agile emphasizes incremental testing to identify and resolve issues throughout the development process.
Documentation;
Waterfall, in contrast, relies heavily on documenting each step-in detail to ensure that all team members are on the same page.
Agile relies on minimal documentation, focusing on self-organizing teams and collaboration.
Communication;
In waterfall, communication is more formal, with detailed communication plans and progress reports shared across multiple stakeholders.
Agile emphasizes informal communication, with frequent interactions between individuals or small groups of stakeholders.

Requirements Engineering:
